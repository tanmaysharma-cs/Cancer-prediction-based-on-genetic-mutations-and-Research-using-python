# Cancer-prediction-based-on-genetic-mutations-and-Research-using-python

This project focuses on reducing the time a clinical pathologist does doing extensive research on a specific gene and its mutation to conclude whether the gene would result in cancer.

I have used multiple feature extraction techniques and extensive EDA to finally use Logistic regression , SVM , Naive bayes and Random forest to fine tune the model for the best result.

Data: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)

Problem statement : Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data

We have two data files: one conatins the information about the genetic mutations and the other contains the clinical evidence (text) that human experts/pathologists use to classify the genetic mutations.
Both these data files are have a common column called ID

My goal here is to classify which genetic mutations would result in cancer as not all gentic mutations result in cancer.
